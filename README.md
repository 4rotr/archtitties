# ArchTitties
Probably the Arch Linux installation script that'll work for you.

# THIS SCRIPT IS VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT - ONLY TESTED IN A VM

## Why is it called ArchTitties?
Purely for comedic value, however it's an acronym for **T**he **I**nstaller **T**hat **T**ries to **I**nstall **E**verything **S**uddenly. 

## What can ArchTitties do?
Install Arch Linux and a desktop environment in potentially under 5 minutes. Also installs Nvidia drivers if you have a GeForce graphics card present.

## What can it not do?
Nothing if you can edit it with some useful tweaks.

## Is it just you that works on ArchTitties, 4rotr?
Yes, for now.
