# ArchTitties
Probably the Arch Linux installation script that'll work for you.

## Why is it called ArchTitties?
Let's get this out of the way. There's another installation script called Archtitus. While talking about a potential alternative to archinstall with some friends after some... bad experiences (aka: I've personally had no systems boot with an archinstall setup), we moved onto talking about Archtitus. Then someone came in and said "archtitties" and I agreed to make that the name of the installer.

Otherwise, there's really no reason as to why this is called ArchTitties other than comedic value. However, I can assure that it'll be a working product.

## What does it do?
Installs Arch. Pretty much it. For now, heavily command based rather than being a flashy GUI, but hey - the product should be functional.

## How does it do this?
A few bash scripts.

## What does it install?
Arch Linux, duh. In all seriousness, it installs the *base, base-devel, linux, linux-firmware, nano, xorg, lightdm, lightdm-gtk-greeter, xfce4 and networkmanager* packages. This should kinda be enough to get Arch running in a virtual machine and AMD systems, for those that use Nvidia systems like myself something will be coming for that too.

## When will it release?
Probably some time in 2022. I have life and school to deal with.
